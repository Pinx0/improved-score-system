[b]WHAT IS THIS?[/b]

This mod aims to improve multiplayer competitive experience which usually ends up with a group of players allied and dominating all others.

The vanilla score from the game fails to represent correctly who is actually winning a game, especially in multiplayer, where quality of the troops adquires much more importance than development for instance.

The idea is to have a bunch of key provinces scattered across the whole world, that gives yearly ticks to whoever is owning them in that moment.

Score is very exponential, so a game can never be decided before 1750, because only 50% of the points have been given by that time. Shall a major power arise and conquer the key provinces, and it could still overcome the previous winner.

With this the mods achieves maximum competitiveness until last day and also forces top players to steal lands from each others to not only gain more points, but to prevent the others from winning them. Think of them as global victory cards.

Also, there are 4 types of provinces giving 10, 4, 2 and 1 base point each. The types stand for: major capitals (red), usually contested provinces (orange), and lastly regional (yellow) and local (green and blue) important provinces.

[b]COMPATIBILITY[/b]

This mod has been tested on 1.26 Mughals. As for other mods, any mod that doesn't alter mission graphics or structure should be compatible as this uses a 6th column.
